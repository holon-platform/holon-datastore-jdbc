== Introduction

The Holon *JDBC Datastore* is the _Java DataBase Connectivity_ reference implementation of the link:../../api/holon-core/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/Datastore.html[Datastore^] API. 

TIP: See the link:holon-core.html#Datastore[Datastore] documentation for further information about the Datastore `API`.

The JDBC `Datastore` implementation uses the Java `javax.sql.DataSource` API to access the the physical data source and the _SQL_ language to perform data access and management operations.

=== Sources and contributions

The Holon Platform *JDBC Datastore* module source code is available from the GitHub repository link:https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-datastore-jdbc[https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-datastore-jdbc^].

See the repository `README` file for information about:

* The source code structure.
* How to build the module artifacts from sources.
* Where to find the code examples.
* How to contribute to the module development.

== Security related considerations

The SQL composition engine of JDBC Datastore API is designed to *avoid and prevent SQL injection type attacks*, since a meta-language is used for the Datastore operations definition a any provided _parameter_ value is managed using JDBC `PreparedStatement` statements types.

== Obtaining the artifacts

The Holon Platform uses https://maven.apache.org[Maven^] for projects build and configuration. All the platform artifacts are published in the *Maven Central Repository*, so there is no need to explicitly declare additional repositories in your project `pom` file.

At the top of each _section_ of this documentation you will find the Maven _coordinates_ (group id, artifact id and version) to obtain the artifact(s) as a dependency for your project.

A *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* `pom` is provided to import the available dependencies for a specific version in your projects. The Maven coordinates for the core BOM are the following:

_Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform.jdbc</groupId>
<artifactId>holon-datastore-jdbc-bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The BOM can be imported in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform.jdbc</groupId>
			<artifactId>holon-datastore-jdbc-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Using the Platform BOM

The Holon Platform provides an *overall Maven BOM (Bill of Materials)* to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts.

See link:index.html#obtain-the-platform-artifacts[Obtain the platform artifacts] for details.

[[WhatsNew51x]]
== What's new in version 5.1.x

* Support of the the `PropertySet` *identifier properties* to detect the persistent entities primary keys avoiding additional database accesses. See <<IdentifierResolutionStrategy>>.

* Full support for date and time *functions* and for `java.time.*` temporal types. See link:holon-core.html#TemporalFunctions[Datastore API temporal functions support^].

* Technology-independent *transactions* support through the `Transactional` API. See <<Transactions>>.

* Complete and deep revision and rewriting of the internal *SQL composer engine*, which is now separated as an independent artifact (`holon-datastore-jdbc-composer`). This ensures more consistent operation resolution strategies, remarkable performance improvements and extensibility by design. See <<JDBCDatastoreExtension>>.

* Improved support for industry-standard vendors RDBMS, such as Oracle Database, Microsoft SQLServer, IBM DB2 and SAP HANA.

[[MigratingFrom50x]]
=== Migrating from version 5.0.x

==== Deprecations

* *JdbcDatastore Builder API*: link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/datastore/jdbc/JdbcDatastore.Builder.html#autoCommit-boolean-[autoCommit^]. The default auto-commit mode setup for JDBC connections is deprecated in favor of the new _transactional_ API support. Transactional operations should be used to manage connections auto-commit. See <<Transactions>>.

==== Dialects

Because of the complete and deep revision and rewriting of the internal SQL composer engine, the package structure and class name is deeply changed. This not affects the public API in any way, only the concrete _sql dialect_ implementations were relocated and the dialect class name is changed from `JdbcDialect` to `SQLDialect`.

The new dialect implementations can be found in the `holon-datastore-jdbc-composer` artifact, under the `com.holonplatform.datastore.jdbc.composer.dialect` package.

So if a dialect fully qualified class name was used to specify the JDBC Datastore dialect, it has to be replaced with the new `SQLDialect` implementation class.

==== SQL filter and sort

The `com.holonplatform.datastore.jdbc.JdbcWhereFilter` and `com.holonplatform.datastore.jdbc.JdbcOrderBySort`, which allow custom `QueryFilter` and `QuerySort` declarations directly providing the SQL `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` parts, are replaced with the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/datastore/jdbc/WhereFilter.html[WhereFilter^] and link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/datastore/jdbc/OrderBySort.html[OrderBySort^] classes, located in the `holon-datastore-jdbc-composer` artifact.

The classes semantic and API is the same as before. See <<CustomSQLFilterSort>>.

// Inclusions

include::_datastore.adoc[]

include::_spring.adoc[]

== Loggers

By default, the Holon platform uses the https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J^] API for logging. The use of SLF4J is optional: it is enabled when the presence of SLF4J is detected in the classpath. Otherwise, logging will fall back to JUL (`java.util.logging`).

The logger name for the *JDBC Datastore* module is `com.holonplatform.datastore.jdbc`.

== System requirements

=== Java

The Holon Platform JDBC Datastore module requires https://www.java.com[Java] *8* or higher.

=== JDBC Drivers

To retrieve back the database generated keys, the JDBC driver in use must be compliant to the *JDBC API version 3 or higher*.
